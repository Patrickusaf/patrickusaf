First post about the routes I make with my 'little black girl'.
For all those who are interested in locations I will try to link the names with webpages, so you can follow websites while you are reading this post.

This one was about drive across San Jos√© del Valle  Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
