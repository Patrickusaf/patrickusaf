# Introduction

First post about the routes I make with my 'little black girl'.
For all those who are interested in locations I will try to link the names with webpages, so you can follow websites while you are reading this post.

This one was about drive across San José del Valle.

# Planning the route

Actually we didn't know where we rode that day but we just began our journey as always —meeting up in Bornos/Algodonales—. Having a breakfast in Venta Salas we discussed where to go and finally we set that our final stop would be Puerto de Gáliz.

So this was our day route.
